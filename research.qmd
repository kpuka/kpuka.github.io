My research sits at the intersection of health, behavior, and policy, with the overarching goal of improving health outcomes and systems of care for Canadians. I have focused much of my work on the cognitive and mental health sequelae of pediatric conditionsâ€”particularly epilepsy, where 80% of children experience cognitive, psychiatric, and/or psychosocial impairments. These comorbidities often go undiagnosed and untreated, despite being stronger predictors of long-term outcomes than seizure activity itself. My academic research aimed to identify mechanisms driving these impairments and to evaluate behavioral interventions that support affected children and families.

More recently, in my work with the federal government, I have broadened this focus to include population-level health behavior and health system research. This includes leading large-scale behavioural science and data initiatives to understand and influence public health decisions, with a particular emphasis on areas such as mental health, infectious disease, and public health emergencies. I apply advanced quantitative methods and contribute to methods development to navigate the complex, real-world data challenges that often emerge in applied policy settings.
